# City Landscape + Clock in Unity

Key features:
- Orthographic scene in Unity that showcases a charming small city.
- The entire scene rotates at a slow and soothing speed.
- You can interact with the scene by controlling the rotation using the left mouse button.
- The centerpiece of the city is an elegant clock placed at its heart.
- The theme and lighting changes according to the current time.
- Three scripts were employed to enhance the functionality:
  - SceneRotator.cs: This script allows you to control the rotation of the scene.
  - TimeScript.cs: This script dynamically updates the positions of the hour, minute, and second hands of the clock based on the current time.
  - DayNightCycle.cs: This script changes the theme as well as the lighting according to the current time. Four themes: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night.
- WebGL project deployed on Vercel.

All the models in the scene were created within Unity itself, utilizing the available primitive shapes. The result is a visually pleasing city landscape with a fully functional clock.
